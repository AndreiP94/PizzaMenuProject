This code represents a React web application designed for a pizzeria. It consists of several components that work together to create a user-friendly interface for customers to view the pizzeria's menu and place orders.

Header Component: This component displays the name of the pizzeria, providing users with a clear indication of where they are on the website.

Menu Component: Here, the application renders a list of pizzas available for purchase. It dynamically generates pizza items based on data stored in the pizzaData.js file. Each pizza item includes details such as its name, ingredients, and price. This component ensures that customers can easily browse through the available options.

Pizza Component: This component is responsible for rendering each individual pizza item within the menu. It receives data about a specific pizza as props and displays its details, including an image, name, ingredients, and price. Additionally, it indicates whether a pizza is sold out by visually marking it as such.

Footer Component: The footer provides essential information about the pizzeria, including its operating hours. It dynamically checks the current time and informs users whether the pizzeria is currently open for orders. If the pizzeria is closed, it prompts users to return during its operating hours.

Overall, this application aims to enhance the user experience by presenting a visually appealing menu and providing relevant information, such as operating hours, to facilitate the ordering process for customers.
